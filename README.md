## Security

### Webhook Security

The webhook trigger includes built-in security features:

- **HMAC-SHA256 Signature Verification** - All webhooks verified using signatures
- **Replay Attack Protection** - Rejects webhook requests older than 5 minutes
- **Timing-Safe Comparison** - Prevents timing attacks
- **Configurable Verification** - Enable/disable signature and replay protection in trigger settings

### Input Validation

- **Email Validation** - RFC 5322 compliant validation
- **UUID Validation** - Format validation for envelope/template IDs
- **Base64 Validation** - Document content validation
- **URL Validation** - Blocks internal/private network URLs to prevent SSRF attacks:
  - localhost, 127.0.0.1, 0.0.0.0
  - Private ranges: 10.x.x.x, 172.16-31.x.x, 192.168.x.x
  - Link-local: 169.254.x.x (AWS metadata endpoint)

### Token Security

- JWT tokens cached in memory only (never persisted)
- Automatic refresh 5 minutes before expiration
- RSA keys handled securely via n8n credentials

## Error Handling

The node includes built-in error handling with detailed messages:

- **Continue on Fail**: Enable to process remaining items even if some fail
- **Detailed Errors**: Field-level error details for validation failures
- **Automatic Retry**: Rate limit and server errors automatically retried

### Error Code Reference

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 400 | Bad Request - Invalid or malformed request |
| 401 | Unauthorized - Invalid credentials or expired token |
| 403 | Forbidden - No permission to access resource |
| 404 | Not Found - Envelope or template does not exist |
| 429 | Rate Limited - Too many requests (auto-retry) |
| 500+ | Server Error - DocuSign server issue (auto-retry) |

## Troubleshooting

### "consent_required" Error

1. Visit the consent URL for your environment (demo or production)
2. Log in with the user account specified in credentials
3. Grant access to the integration

### "Invalid JWT" Error

1. Verify your RSA private key is complete (including BEGIN/END lines)
2. Check Integration Key (Client ID) is correct
3. Ensure User ID matches the account granting consent

### Webhook Not Receiving Events

1. Verify the webhook URL is publicly accessible
2. Check DocuSign Connect configuration matches n8n URL
3. Verify HMAC secret matches (if using signature verification)
4. Check event types are enabled in Connect settings

### Rate Limiting Issues

If you encounter rate limiting (429 errors):

1. The node automatically retries with backoff
2. Reduce frequency of API calls
3. Use "Return All" sparingly for large datasets
4. Consider caching responses where appropriate
